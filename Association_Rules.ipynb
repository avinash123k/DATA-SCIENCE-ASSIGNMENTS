        "1. **Lift** is a measure of how much more often two items occur together than we would expect if they were independent. A lift value greater than 1 indicates a positive association (the presence of one item increases the likelihood of the other). It’s important because it highlights relationships that are not just frequent but also meaningful, filtering out coincidental co-occurrences.\n"

        "   **Confidence** measures the strength of an association rule. It’s the probability of finding item B in transactions that already contain item A. For example, if 30 out of 50 transactions with eggs also include milk, then confidence for eggs → milk is 30/50 = 0.6 (60%)."

        "### Conclusion\n",
        "From the Association Rule Mining, we discovered interesting relationships between products frequently purchased together.  \n",
        "- **Support** helped us identify how often an itemset occurs in transactions.  \n",
        "- **Confidence** showed the strength of the conditional relationship between products.  \n",
        "- **Lift** highlighted whether the co-occurrence of items was stronger than random chance.  \n",
        "\n",
        "The rules reveal patterns such as certain beverages often being bought together, or healthier products like yogurt and mineral water having strong associations.  \n",
        "\n",
        "These insights can be valuable for:  \n",
        "- **Product placement** in stores (placing strongly associated items near each other).  \n",
        "- **Cross-selling strategies** (suggesting complementary products).  \n",
        "- **Targeted promotions** (bundling items with high lift values).  \n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, Association Rule Mining provides actionable knowledge about customer purchasing behavior that businesses can use to improve sales strategies.\n"
